This repo contains some schematics for Mindustry.

## How to use

The best way is to use [Schematic Browser](https://github.com/eeve-lyn/schematic-browser), which lets you insert schematics from GitHub repositories without needing to first add them to your collection.

1. In the Mindustry menu, choose “Mods”.
2. Open the mod browser.
